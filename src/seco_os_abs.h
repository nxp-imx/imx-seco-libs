/**
 * Opens a MU channel
 * Purpose of this function is to setup a communication channel using a messaging unit (MU)
 * between the caller of this function and SECO.
 * This session is uniquely identified by a platform handle.
 * The pointer to this handle is returned here and has to be provided by the user
 * on each call to platform dependent functions.
 * The details of the seco_os_abs_hdl structure are not described in this API so
 * it can be custmized for each OS/platform porting.
 *
 * One physical MU can be shared between several sessions but concurrent access
 * should be protected. Seco can only process one command at a time. Once a command
 * has been sent to SECO no other command should be sent on the physical MU (even by
 * other sessions sharing same physical MU) until the response has been received.
 * (but a response to a command from Seco should not be blocked - e.g. in storage case)
 *
 * The mapping between physical MUs and sessions is considered as platform dependent.
 * So no assumption are made about this by the caller.
 *
 * \param type constant indicating for which purpose will be used this channel (see defines below)
 * \param mu_params pointer where the MU params for this channel should be written. It is up to this
 *                  abstraction layer to provide a mapping between channel types and associated MU
 *                  params. Caller need to know these information to fill some SECO messages.
 *
 * \return pointer to the MU channel handle.

 * the result can be accessed by the caller after seco sent the response by either:

 * It also provides the address to be inserted into the message to be sent to Seco: either the
 * physical address or the offset in the shared buffer (see options below) yo be used by Seco.
 *
 * Several options are available to describe the buffers.
 * DATA_BUF_IS_INPUT: the buffer described here is input to the next command. Otherwise this is an output.
 * DATA_BUF_USE_SEC_MEM: the data should be copied to the shared buffer in secure memory or the output will
 * be stored by Seco in it. It is expected that the buffers will be allocated in a contiguous manner in this
 * shared memory since some optimizations depend on this (fast MAC).
 * If not set any other memory can be used (e.g. DDR). In this case this API should take care of cache coherency
 * and access rights before Seco tries access the physical memory.
